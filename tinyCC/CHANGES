Version 2.1.1

Added support for Urdu Sentence Boundary

Version 2.1

Changed usage of text2satz.jar: In order to process UTF-8 text appropriate
locales need to be set in `tinyCC.sh`. As text2satz works byte-oriented a
double encoding error occurs which gets worked around by `recode`ing the
result.

Changed tokenization: When processing UTF-8 text without an appropriate
combination of encodings a small fraction of characters got garbled by the
tokenizer in earlier versions.  Included fixes for this mis-behaviour.

Expanded token list: More quotation signs and currency symbols can be
covered in UTF-8 than in ASCII. Tokenization has been adapted to consider
these characters.
